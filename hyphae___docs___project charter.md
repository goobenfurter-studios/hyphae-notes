# Executive Summary
	- A hypha (pl. hyphae) is the filament a fungus uses to connect to its mycelial network. With this context, [[Hyphae]] aims to provide a [[lang/nim]] library that allows a user to start their own "mycelial network" within the [[Fediverse]] by implementing [[(streams)]], a federated communications server that uses [[ActivityPub]] and [[Nomad]]. Specifically, Hyphae allows the user to establish a [[nomadic identity]] that allows them to enter their network from multiple points rather than just one server or domain.
- # Project Scope
	- ## Goals and Objectives
		- Hyphae's primary purpose is to provide a protocol library for [[nomadic identity]] in the [[Fediverse]]. To accomplish this goal, there are several intermediate objectives:
		- Implement the protocols used by [[(streams)]]:
		  logseq.order-list-type:: number
			- [[ActivityPub]]
			  logseq.order-list-type:: number
			- [[Nomad]]
			  logseq.order-list-type:: number
	- ## Outcomes and Deliverables
		- A protocol library implementation of [[(streams)]]
		- A test suite for at minimum every call to the API
		- Documentation for both a user and a developer
	- ## Out of Scope
		- a server implementation beyond what is necessary for testing
- # Project Development
	- ## Context
		- TODO explanation of [[Fediverse]]
			- flaw in current identity implementation: tied to single domain aka single point of failure
		- TODO history of [[(streams)]]
	- ## Requirements
		- **API Documentation:** The library API should be documented concisely (thoroughly but clearly) for easy implementation in external projects.
		- **Completeness:** The library should implement the complete set of features provided by the protocol.
		- **Portability:** The API should easily bind to whatever interface. For this reason, providing a [[lang/c]] FFI is essential.
		- **Performance:** The library should perform reasonably well in an application. This means being conservative and secure with resources and memory on the machine as well as on the network.
		- **Testing:** The library API should be tested with a suite, not necessarily in a real-world application.
	- ## Timeline
		- TODO
	- ## Prototypes
		- The initial prototype will be a proof of concept library implementation that is not necessarily tested in any real-world applications.
- # Team Development
	- ## Mission and Objectives
		- The Hyphae's team mission is to provide another implementation of the [[Nomad]] protocol used by [[(streams)]] as well as
			- practicing test-driven development,
			- writing back end modules,
			- learning back end tooling, and
			- gaining project management experience.

	- ## Relationships
		- **[[(streams)]]:** Hyphae is based on this project but has chosen a language other than [[lang/php]] for its implementation.
